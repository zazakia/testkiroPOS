### Data Flow Pattern

All modules follow this consistent pattern:

1. User interacts with UI Component
2. Component calls API Route or Server Action
3. API Route validates input using Zod Schema
4. API Route delegates to Service Layer
5. Service Layer applies business rules and orchestrates operations
6. Service Layer calls Repository for data operations
7. Repository uses Prisma to execute database queries
8. Results flow back through the layers
9. UI updates with new data or error messages

## Part 3: Business Logic Requirements

### Weighted Average Cost Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate inventory valuation using weighted average costing method

**Algorithm**:
```
For each product in each warehouse:
1. Retrieve all active batches with quantity > 0
2. Calculate total cost = SUM(batch.quantity × batch.unitCost)
3. Calculate total quantity = SUM(batch.quantity)
4. Weighted average cost = total cost ÷ total quantity
5. If no batches exist, return 0
```

**Usage**: Used for COGS calculation in POS sales and inventory valuation reports

### FIFO Stock Deduction

**Purpose**: Deduct inventory prioritizing earliest expiration dates to minimize waste

**Algorithm**:
```
When deducting stock:
1. Convert requested quantity to base UOM
2. Fetch active batches ordered by expiryDate ASC
3. Loop through batches:
   a. Calculate deduction from current batch (min of batch quantity and remaining needed)
   b. Update batch quantity
   c. Record stock movement
   d. Subtract deducted amount from remaining needed
4. If insufficient stock after all batches, throw error
5. Return success
```

### UOM Conversion Logic

**Purpose**: Convert quantities between different units of measure

**Algorithm**:
```
Convert to Base UOM:
1. If UOM equals product.baseUOM, return quantity as-is
2. Find ProductUOM record matching the UOM name
3. If not found, throw "UOM not found" error
4. Return quantity × conversionFactor

Convert from Base UOM:
1. Find ProductUOM record
2. Return quantity ÷ conversionFactor
```

**Example**: 
- Product: Coca-Cola, Base UOM: bottle
- Alternate UOM: carton, Conversion Factor: 24
- Converting 2 cartons to base: 2 × 24 = 48 bottles

### Purchase Order Receiving Workflow

**Purpose**: Automatically create inventory batches and accounts payable when PO is received

**Steps**:
1. Validate PO status is "ordered"
2. Begin database transaction
3. For each PO item:
   - Generate unique batch number
   - Calculate expiry date = receivedDate + product.shelfLifeDays
   - Create InventoryBatch with PO unit cost
   - Record StockMovement (type: IN, reference: PO)
4. Update PO status to "received" and set actualDeliveryDate
5. Calculate due date based on supplier payment terms
6. Create AccountsPayable record
7. Commit transaction
8. Return created batches

### POS Sale Processing

**Purpose**: Process point-of-sale transactions with inventory deduction and COGS calculation

**Steps**:
1. Begin database transaction
2. Validate stock availability for all items
3. For each cart item:
   - Get weighted average cost for product/warehouse
   - Convert quantity to base UOM
   - Calculate COGS = weighted average cost × base quantity
   - Deduct inventory using FIFO logic
4. Calculate subtotal = SUM(item quantities × UOM selling prices)
5. Calculate tax = subtotal × 0.12
6. Calculate total = subtotal + tax
7. Create POSSale record with generated receipt number
8. Create POSSaleItem records with COGS
9. If converting from sales order, update SO status and link
10. Commit transaction
11. Return sale with receipt number

### Module 7: Purchase Order to Receiving Voucher Conversion (NEW FEATURE - HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Business Purpose
Enable accurate inventory receiving by tracking actual received quantities versus ordered quantities, providing variance analysis and flexible inventory updates based on what was actually delivered.

#### Current Status
Current PO receiving workflow automatically creates inventory batches for full ordered quantities without allowing verification of actual received amounts. This new feature adds a Receiving Voucher intermediate step.

#### Functional Requirements

##### Receiving Voucher Workflow

**Step 1: Create Receiving Voucher from PO**
- When user clicks "Receive" on an ordered PO, open Receiving Voucher creation dialog
- Pre-populate voucher with PO details and items
- Allow editing of received quantities per item
- Display ordered quantity vs received quantity comparison
- Calculate variances (quantity difference and percentage)
- Support partial receiving (some items fully received, others partial or not received)
- Add delivery notes and receiver name fields
- Generate unique Receiving Voucher Number (RV-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)

**Step 2: Quantity Verification**
- For each PO item, display:
  - Product name and description
  - Ordered quantity in base UOM
  - Editable received quantity field
  - Variance: (Received - Ordered) with color coding
    - Green: Exact match (variance = 0)
    - Yellow: Under-delivery (variance < 0)
    - Red: Over-delivery (variance > 0)
  - Variance percentage: ((Received - Ordered) / Ordered) × 100
- Allow reasons for variances:
  - Damaged items
  - Expired items
  - Supplier shortage
  - Over-shipment
  - Wrong items delivered

**Step 3: Save and Process Receiving Voucher**
- Validate that at least one item has received quantity > 0
- Create ReceivingVoucher record in database
- Create ReceivingVoucherItem records for each line
- Create inventory batches ONLY for received quantities (not ordered quantities)
- Record stock movements with reference to Receiving Voucher
- Update PO status based on receiving completion:
  - "fully_received": All items received in full
  - "partially_received": Some items received or partial quantities
  - "ordered": No items received yet
- Create AP record based on received amount, not ordered amount
- Calculate AP amount: SUM(received quantity × unit price)

##### Receiving Voucher Management

**Receiving Voucher List**
- Table showing all receiving vouchers
- Columns: RV Number, PO Number, Supplier, Warehouse, Total Items, Received Items, Total Amount, Status, Created Date
- Filters: Date range, Supplier, Warehouse, Branch, Status
- Search by RV number or PO number
- Status badges:
  - Complete: All items fully received
  - Partial: Some variances exist
  - Pending: Awaiting approval
- Action buttons: View Details, Print, Approve (if pending)

#### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema Enhancement**

Add new tables:

```
model ReceivingVoucher {
  id                String   @id @default(uuid())
  rvNumber          String   @unique
  purchaseOrderId   String
  warehouseId       String

  status            String   @default("complete")
  totalOrderedAmount Decimal @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  totalReceivedAmount Decimal @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  varianceAmount    Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  receivedDate      DateTime @default(now())
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime @updatedAt
  
  purchaseOrder     PurchaseOrder @relation(fields: [purchaseOrderId], references: [id])
  warehouse         Warehouse @relation(fields: [warehouseId], references: [id])
  branch            Branch @relation(fields: [branchId], references: [id])
  items             ReceivingVoucherItem[]
}

model ReceivingVoucherItem {
  id                String   @id @default(uuid())
  rvId              String
  productId         String

  receivingVoucher  ReceivingVoucher @relation(fields: [rvId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  product           Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
}
```

Update PurchaseOrder model:
```
model PurchaseOrder {
  // ... existing fields
  receivingStatus   String?  @default("pending") // pending, partially_received, fully_received
  
  receivingVouchers ReceivingVoucher[]
}
```

Update PurchaseOrderItem model:
```
model PurchaseOrderItem {
  // ... existing fields
  receivedQuantity  Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2) @default(0)
}
```

**Service Layer**: `receiving-voucher.service.ts`

Methods:
- `createReceivingVoucher(data: CreateRVInput): Promise<ReceivingVoucher>` - Create RV from PO
- `getReceivingVoucherById(id: string): Promise<RVWithDetails>` - Fetch single RV with items
- `listReceivingVouchers(filters: RVFilters): Promise<ReceivingVoucher[]>` - List with filters
- `generateRVNumber(): Promise<string>` - Generate unique RV-YYYYMMDD-XXXX
- `calculateVariances(items: RVItemInput[]): RVItemWithVariance[]` - Calculate variances
- `processReceiving(rvId: string): Promise<void>` - Process inventory and AP creation
- `getVarianceReport(filters: DateRange): Promise<VarianceReport>` - Generate variance report

**Processing Logic**:
```
When creating Receiving Voucher:
1. Validate PO exists and status is "ordered"
2. Validate at least one item has receivedQuantity > 0
3. Begin database transaction
4. Generate unique RV number
5. For each item:
   a. Calculate variance: receivedQuantity - orderedQuantity
   b. Calculate variance percentage: (variance / orderedQuantity) × 100
   c. Calculate line total: receivedQuantity × unitPrice
6. Calculate totals:
   a. totalOrderedAmount = SUM(orderedQuantity × unitPrice)
   b. totalReceivedAmount = SUM(receivedQuantity × unitPrice)
   c. varianceAmount = totalReceivedAmount - totalOrderedAmount
7. Create ReceivingVoucher record
8. Create ReceivingVoucherItem records
9. For each item with receivedQuantity > 0:
   a. Create inventory batch with receivedQuantity
   b. Set referenceId to RV.id and referenceType to "RV"
   c. Record stock movement
   d. Update PurchaseOrderItem.receivedQuantity
10. Update PO status:
    a. If all items fully received: "fully_received"
    b. If some items received: "partially_received"
    c. Else: remain "ordered"
11. Create AccountsPayable with totalReceivedAmount
12. Commit transaction
13. Return created RV
```

**API Routes**:
- `POST /api/receiving-vouchers` - Create receiving voucher from PO
- `GET /api/receiving-vouchers` - List all receiving vouchers with filters
- `GET /api/receiving-vouchers/[id]` - Get single RV with details
- `GET /api/purchase-orders/[id]/receiving-vouchers` - Get RVs for a PO
- `POST /api/receiving-vouchers/[id]/approve` - Approve pending RV
- `GET /api/reports/receiving-variance` - Generate variance report

**Validation Schema**: `lib/validations/receiving-voucher.validation.ts`

```
const receivingVoucherItemSchema = z.object({
  productId: z.string().uuid(),
  orderedQuantity: z.number().positive(),
  receivedQuantity: z.number().min(0),
  varianceReason: z.string().optional(),
  unitPrice: z.number().positive(),
});

const createReceivingVoucherSchema = z.object({
  purchaseOrderId: z.string().uuid(),
  receiverName: z.string().min(1, "Receiver name is required"),
  deliveryNotes: z.string().optional(),
  items: z.array(receivingVoucherItemSchema)
    .min(1, "At least one item is required")
    .refine(
      (items) => items.some(item => item.receivedQuantity > 0),
      "At least one item must have received quantity greater than zero"
    ),
});
```

**Page**: `/app/(dashboard)/receiving-vouchers/page.tsx`

##### User Interface Flow

**Creating Receiving Voucher from PO**:
1. User navigates to PO detail page
2. Clicks "Receive" button (for status = "ordered")
3. Opens Receiving Voucher Dialog with:
   - Pre-filled PO details (read-only)
   - Receiver Name input
   - Delivery Notes textarea
   - Items table with columns:
     - Product Name (read-only)
     - Ordered Qty (read-only)
     - Received Qty (editable number input)
     - Variance (calculated, color-coded)
     - Variance % (calculated)
     - Variance Reason (dropdown: Damaged, Expired, Shortage, Over-shipment, Wrong Item, Other)
     - Unit Price (read-only)
     - Line Total (calculated)
4. User enters received quantities for each item
5. System calculates variances in real-time
6. Summary section shows:
   - Total Ordered: ₱ X,XXX.XX
   - Total Received: ₱ X,XXX.XX
   - Variance: ₱ X,XXX.XX (red if negative, green if positive)
7. User clicks "Save & Process"
8. System validates and creates RV
9. Success message: "Receiving Voucher RV-YYYYMMDD-XXXX created successfully. X inventory batches created."
10. Option to print RV or view details

**Benefits**:

## Part 7: Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach

#### Unit Testing
- Test service layer methods in isolation
- Mock Prisma calls
- Verify business logic calculations (weighted average, FIFO, etc.)
- Use Vitest for unit tests

#### Integration Testing
- Test API routes with real database
- Verify complete workflows (PO receiving, POS sale, payment recording)
- Test data consistency across transactions
- Use test database separate from development

#### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows in browser
- Verify UI interactions and data flow
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Test critical paths:
  - Create product → Add stock → Process POS sale
  - Create PO → Receive PO → Verify inventory and AP
  - Record AR payment → Verify balance update
  - Generate reports → Verify calculations

### Test Coverage Goals

| Layer | Target Coverage | Priority Tests |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Service Layer | 80%+ | Business logic, calculations |
| Repository Layer | 70%+ | CRUD operations, complex queries |
| API Routes | 90%+ | All endpoints, error cases |
| UI Components | 60%+ | Critical user interactions |

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Inventory**:
   - Deducting more stock than available
   - Transferring between warehouses when destination is at capacity
   - Adding stock with negative quantities
   - FIFO deduction with multiple batches

2. **Financial**:
   - Recording payment exceeding balance
   - Partial payments
   - Overdue calculations
   - Aging bucket boundaries

3. **POS**:
   - Empty cart checkout
   - Converting already-converted sales order
   - Cash payment with insufficient amount received
   - Stock availability changes during checkout

4. **Reports**:
   - Empty data sets
   - Very large date ranges
   - Division by zero in calculations
   - Null values in aggregations

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Use the same architectural patterns as existing modules (service → repository → Prisma)

2. **Reuse Components**: Leverage existing shadcn/ui components and shared components

3. **Maintain Consistency**: Match existing UI/UX design, naming conventions, and code style

4. **Incremental Development**: Build and test each module independently before integration

5. **Data Integrity**: Ensure all calculations match business requirements exactly

6. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

7. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and paginate large datasets

8. **Testing**: Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next

### Confidence Assessment

**Confidence Level**: High (85%)

**Confidence Basis**:
- Clear architectural patterns already established in codebase
- Backend services mostly complete, reducing implementation risk
- Well-defined requirements and specifications
- Proven technology stack
- Realistic timeline with buffer for testing

**Risks**:
- Complexity of financial calculations (mitigated by thorough testing)
- Integration complexity between modules (mitigated by incremental approach)
- Performance with large datasets (mitigated by pagination and optimization)

## Conclusion

This comprehensive PRD provides a complete roadmap to bring InventoryPro from 70% to 100% completion with an enhanced PO receiving workflow. The implementation focuses on:

1. **Critical Business Intelligence**: Dashboard and alerts for operational visibility
2. **Financial Management**: Complete AR/AP/Expense UI for cash flow management
3. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Full business analytics and financial statements
4. **Enhanced Receiving Process**: NEW Receiving Voucher module for accurate inventory receiving with variance tracking
5. **Feature Completion**: Sales order conversion and other incomplete features

The modular approach ensures existing functionality remains intact while systematically adding missing components. All new modules follow established architectural patterns, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

### Key Enhancements with Receiving Voucher Module

The new Receiving Voucher feature provides:
- **Accurate Inventory Recording**: Track actual received quantities vs. ordered quantities
- **Variance Analysis**: Identify discrepancies for supplier performance evaluation
- **Proper Cost Control**: Create AP based on actual receipts, not estimates
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all receiving activities
- **Flexible Receiving**: Support partial deliveries and multiple shipments per PO
- **Better Decision Making**: Variance reports help identify supplier issues and improve procurement

**Revised Total Effort**: 344 hours (approximately 43 working days or 8-9 weeks with one developer)

**Expected Outcome**: A fully functional, production-ready inventory management and POS system with comprehensive business intelligence capabilities and industry-standard receiving processes that ensure inventory accuracy and proper financial controls.
